CLI Application
This is my Accounting Ledger Application.
Hi my name is Kendell Holmes a current Student at YearUpUnited in the Application Development track.

This application allows one to add deposits, view the deposits, make payments and view the payments that were made.
And if you're looking for the payment history it is stored in the csv file.
The Deposit and Payment each have a slot for the date/time/description/vendor/and the amount.

This is the transcations.csv file where the payments and deposits are stored.

 So again the storage/data is in the csv file 
 But I also wanted to highlight the import statements at the top of my code since they do alot for you and I when using this this app

 These are Java import statements. 
 They tell your program which classes it needs to borrow from a package.
 It's somewhat like identifying a certain area that needs to be shown, by importing classes like Scanner or FileReader.
 And here's an exmaple of where they show up later in the code.
